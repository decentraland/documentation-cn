## 安装 CLI 

如何安装，请查看 [文档首页](docs.decentraland.org)。

## 教程

有关构建基本场景的详细说明： 请查看[教程]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /tutorials/2018-01-03-tutorials %}) 。

## 与其他 Jammers 交流

加入 [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2RcqE2)，加入相关的讨论！

您还可以在 [Decentraland University](https://discord.gg/UK6AZCd) 频道获得免费课程。

## 组队

虽然欢迎您单独参与项目，但 Game Jam 通常是团队合作。 联系一下朋友，也许会是一个不错搭档。

您还可以查看[此电子表格](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wCiDIkJwMVO9vUXU5oM4da14PASrwGHno1Ayrapsxa4/edit#gid=0) 发布召集队友或找到要加入的团队。


## 调试

如果有任何问题，我们建议将问题发布到 [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask)，并使用 `decentraland` 或 `decentraland-ecs` 标签。

也可以在 [Discord](https://discord.gg/B2RcqE2) 中询问。 `#developers` 频道是关于代码的问题，`#building` 频道是关于 3D 模型方面问题。

## The Utils library

The Decentraland ESC Utils library includes a number of helper methods that make it easier to carry out a lot of common use cases.

To use any of the helpers provided by the Utils library:

1. Install it as an npm package. Run this command in your scene's project folder:

	```
	npm install decentraland-ecs-utils
	```
2. Import the library into the scene's script. Add this line at the start of your `game.ts` file, or any other TypeScript files that require it:

	```ts
	import utils from "../node_modules/decentraland-ecs-utils/index"
	```

3. In your TypeScript file, write `utils.` and let the suggestions of your IDE show the available helpers.

## 3D Art Assets

A good experience will have great 3D art to go with it. If you're keen on creating those 3D models yourself, you're encouraged to, see the [3D Modeling section of our docs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /3d-modeling/2018-01-09-3d-models %}) for more info. But if you prefer to focus on the coding or game design side of things, you don't need to create your own assets!

Here are a few tips to get great 3D models that you can use in a Decentraland scene:

- Build a scene in the Decentraland [Builder](builder.decentraland.org) and export it, together with all its assets, to keep working on it with the SDK.
- Download all the 3D assets available in the Builder from [this repo](https://github.com/decentraland/builder-assets/tree/master/assets)
- [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com)
- [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
- [Clara.io](https://clara.io/)
- [Archive3D](https://archive3d.net/)
- [SketchUp 3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/)
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) (3D models made primarily for 3D printing, but adaptable to Virtual Worlds)
- [ShareCG](https://www.sharecg.com/)

> Note: Models must be in the supported `.gltf` or `.glb` formats, and must have a number of triangles, textures and materials that adhere to the [scene limitations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /development-guide/2018-01-06-scene-limitations %}).  If getting models from a third party site, pay attention to the licence restrictions that the content you download has.



## Project Examples

Here are some examples submitted from our Hackathon back in June that you can take inspiration from...


[Archery Casino](https://dcl-asmtzkzdmx.now.sh/)

[Mystery Castle](https://mystery.rdixon.now.sh/?position=2%2C7)

[Lightcore](https://brent-ooaissvdra.now.sh/)

[Dexcalibur](https://export.clemlak.now.sh)

[Chipassic Park](https://genetic-experiment-kbjflplqqu.now.sh)


To see our official example scenes, with links to their code, see [scene examples]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /examples/2018-01-08-sample-scenes %}).


## Competition guidelines

- You don’t need to own land to participate. You can choose to submit the code of the scene and to allow us to deploy it to an available land pool. You can otherwise decline this and choose to deploy it to land you or a partner owns. 
- We recommend creating scenes that have a reasonably small LAND footprint, as LAND is scarce and expensive. In general, we recommend a maximum size of 3x3 parcels.
- To keep a level playing field, the scenes submitted for the Game Jam should at least have a significant part of them developed during the two weeks of the competition. When submitting your scene, you should clarify if you reused any prior work as part of the scene.
- We strongly encourage submitted scenes to be interactive. We consider a scene to be interactive if the player’s actions (clicking, walking, etc) can have some kind of effect on the content. A scene is also valuable if it features animations from 3D models or connects to external APIs.
- You will retain all the rights to your assets and code after submitting. We’ll be able to share images or videos of your scene, and we’ll be able to deploy it as-is to the land pool if you choose to allow us. We won’t be able to alter or copy assets or parts of your scene for our own purposes.
- If your scene consists of a game with rules that aren’t self-evident, you should provide instructions, either in-world or in the submit form.
